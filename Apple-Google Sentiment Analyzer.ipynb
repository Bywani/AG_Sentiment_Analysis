    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The South by Southwest Conference (SXSW) is one of the largest tech and media conferences in the world, attracting a diverse range of attendees from developers and entrepreneurs to marketers and social media influencers. During this event, companies like Apple and Google showcase their latest products and technologies, and engage with attendees to gather feedback and build buzz. However, with so much activity taking place at SXSW, it can be difficult for companies to keep track of how customers are feeling about their products and how those feelings may be influencing purchasing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Business Problem:** \n",
    "\n",
    "As an industry leader, it is important for Apple and Google to understand the sentiment of their customers during the SXSW conference. The problem is that with so much noise on social media, it is challenging to manually analyze and classify customer sentiment towards their products. By ignoring or not properly analyzing customer sentiment, Apple and Google may miss out on valuable opportunities to improve customer satisfaction, make data-driven business decisions, and ultimately increase revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution:** \n",
    "\n",
    "One potential solution is to leverage sentiment analysis to automatically classify and analyze the customer sentiment towards Apple and Google products during the SXSW conference. By using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, sentiment analysis can help categorize the tweets collected from Twitter as positive, negative or neutral, thus making it easier for Apple and Google to track customer sentiment and respond to issues quickly. This information can be used to improve customer experience and shape the direction of product development for both companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Data:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The data used for this project comes from CrowdFlower via https://data.world/crowdflower/brands-and-product-emotions, which consists of approximately 9,000 tweets collected during the 2011 South by Southwest Conference. Each tweet in the dataset is labeled as negative, neutral or positive. With this dataset, we can use machine learning algorithms to train models that can predict the sentiment of new tweets and gain insights on customer sentiment towards Apple and Google products during the conference."
